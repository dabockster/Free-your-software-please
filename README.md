# add-a-license-please
A bot that crawls Github for projects without any license, and asks the owner to add a license.

### Flow

- https://developer.github.com/v3/
- http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

1. Get repositories with at least 2 stars sorted by recently updated - https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories
2. For every repository, check in contents if there's a `LICENSE{.*}` file - https://api.github.com/repos/dtrupenn/Tetris/contents . If yes, skip.
4. If not, get the `README{.*}` file - https://api.github.com/repos/dtrupenn/Tetris/contents
  - Get it's raw content: https://api.github.com/repos/karan/projects/contents/README.md
  - Check if there's license info there
  - If yes, skip
  - If not, move to 5.
5. Create an issue - https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#create-an-issue

### Rate limit handling

- Search and use only the top 20 repos
- Cache the repo file listing in step 2
- After every issue created, sleep rand{1..4} minutes.
- After every non-issue repo, sleep rand{0.5..2} minutes.
